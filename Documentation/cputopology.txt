Export cpu topology info via sysfs. Items (attributes) are similar
to /proc/cpuinfo.

1) /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/physical_package_id:
represent the physical package id of  cpu X;
2) /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/core_id:
represent the cpu core id to cpu X;
3) /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/thread_siblings:
represent the thread siblings to cpu X in the same core;
4) /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/core_siblings:
represent the thread siblings to cpu X in the same physical package;

To implement it in an architecture-neutral way, a new source file,
drivers/base/topology.c, is to export the 4 attributes.

For an architecture to support this feature, it must define some of
these macros in include/asm-XXX/topology.h:
#define topology_physical_package_id(cpu)
#define topology_core_id(cpu)
#define topology_thread_siblings(cpu)
#define topology_core_siblings(cpu)

The type of **_id is int.
The type of siblings is cpumask_t.

To be consistent on all architectures, include/linux/topology.h
provides default definitions for any of the above macros that are
not defined by include/asm-XXX/topology.h:
1) physical_package_id: -1
2) core_id: 0
3) thread_siblings: just the given CPU
4) core_siblings: just the given CPU
