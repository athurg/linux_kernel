The following issues are known to exist and will be fixed in a later
patch:

I2S audio issues
  Audio sometimes doesn't play - sometimes when an application is started,
    audio will not play although the stream is being transferred to the
    CODEC. Possible CODEC driver issue.
  Workaround
    Stop and restart the audio stream. This issue only seems to occur on
    the first start.
  Audio stutter at start of stream - the first few audio buffers appear to
    'stutter' during playback and then clear up.
  Workaround
    None - stutter will clear up.

Other issues
  The Linux boot process will lock up if not in service boot mode.
  Workaround:
    Locate the service boot jumper on the board and make sure it is enabled.
