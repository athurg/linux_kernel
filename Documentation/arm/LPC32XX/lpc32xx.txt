	SDMMC support (via the PL180 driver)
	I2C and SPI (via SSP) support
	Support for the 4 standard UARTs and 3 high speed UARTs
	MTD support with the NAND SLC FLASH controller
	Display (LCD) support (via the PL111 driver)
	Touch screen support
	Ethernet and PHY support
	Keyboard scanner support
	1-second RTC support
	Watchdog timer support
	Vectored Floating Point support	
	Power management support
	DMA support (used with I2S, SDMMC, and USB device)

Building the kernel
============================================

To build the kernel, make the kernel with the menu configuation utility and
select the LPC32XX target. Select one of the available target boards for the
platform and the desired options for the target board. Select the drivers and
kernel components as necessary for your build.

The LPC32XX architecture can be selected in the "System Type" submenu from
the kernel configuration menu. Once the "NXP LPC32XX " architecture has been
selected, a specific platform type and configurable platform components are
selected in the "LPC32XX Implementations" submenu. Further chip configurable
components are selected in the "LPC32XX chip components" submenu.

See the section below called "Kernel driver support" for more information on
configuring the kernel's driver support.

Kernel driver support
============================================

USB 2.0 full speed host
--------------------------------------------
The LPC32XX USB host driver is based on the PNX4008 driver and uses the
ISP1301 transceiver for the USB PHY. I2C is used to configure and control
the ISP1301 transceiver - make sure I2C support is enabled and the USB OTG
I2C channel is enabled in the configurable chip components.

USB 2.0 full speed device
--------------------------------------------
Not supported yet.

I2S audio with the UDA1380 audio CODE
--------------------------------------------
I2S audio with the UDA1380 audio CODEC is support on the I2S0 and I2S1
channels under ALSA. Select the appropriate I2S channel for this support
for this interface. UDA1380 support also requires I2C support.

SDMMC support (via the PL180 driver)
--------------------------------------------
SDMMC support (up to 4-bit, 25MHz operation) is provided with the ARM PL180
driver. To enable this support, enable the ARM AMBA PL180 driver.

I2C support
--------------------------------------------
I2C support is provided with the PNX4008 I2C driver. To enable this support,
select the PNX4008 I2C component. Individual I2C channels are enabled in the
configurable chip components.

SPI (via SSP) support
--------------------------------------------
SPI support is provided for FIFO based SPI transfers on the SSP0 and SSP1
channels. Individual SPI channels are enabled in the configurable chip
components.

4 standard UARTs
--------------------------------------------
The 8250 driver provides support for the 4 standard UARTs of the LPC32XX.
To enable this support, select the 8250 serial driver. Individual UARTs can
be enabled in the configurable chip components.

3 high speed UARTs
--------------------------------------------
The 3 high speed UARTs are also supported. Individual UARTs can be enabled
in the configurable chip components. The high speed UARTs are limited to
8-bit transfer mode with no signalling support, but support baud rates as
high as 921Kbps.

MTD support with the NAND SLC FLASH controller
--------------------------------------------
Support for small and large block NAND FLASH devices can be selected by
enabling the LPC32XX NAND component.

Display (LCD) support (via the PL111 driver)
--------------------------------------------
Display support is provided by the ARM PL11x LCD driver. To enable support
for the display, select the ARM Amba PL11x driver.

Touch screen support
--------------------------------------------
Touch screen support is provided by enabling the LPC32XX touchscreen
component.

Ethernet and PHY support
--------------------------------------------
Ethernet support is provided by enabling the LPC32XX ethernet MII component.
A compatible ethernet PHY must also be selected for ethernet to work. MII
or RMII mode is selected in the configurable chip components.

Keyboard scanner support
--------------------------------------------
The keyscanner is supported with the LPC32XX keyscanner component.

1-second RTC support
--------------------------------------------
The 1-second Real Time Clock is supported by enabling the LPC32XX RTC
component. The RTC will keep correct time as long as it is powered on.

Watchdog timer support
--------------------------------------------
WDT support is provided with the PNX4008 WDT driver. To enable this support,
select the PNX4008 WDT component.

LPC32XX based platforms and platform support
============================================

To keep the drivers as platform independent as possible, some of the
drivers require board specific functions developed as part of the board
specific platform. The drivers that require board specific code are:
	Keyboard scanner
	SDMMC
	MTD and MTD partitioning
	Display (LCD) controller
	Ethernet MAC address
	SSP (SPI) CS control
	Board specific power management functions
