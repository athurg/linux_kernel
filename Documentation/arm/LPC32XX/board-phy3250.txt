The Phytec 3250 board
============================================

The Phytec 3250 baord provides a full featured ARM926EJS board based on the
NXP LPC32XX SoC. The board provides support for most interfaces on the SoC
and comes in varying configurations for SDRAM and NAND size. The board is
fully supported by the Linux kernel.

Bootloader support
============================================
Currently, u-boot is supported as the Linux bootloader on the PHY3250 board.
The boot process on the PHY3250 board consists on booting a stage 1 loader
from NAND and then loading and starting u-boot. The stage 1 loader does most
of the board configuration including SDRAM and clock setup. More information
on the stage 1 loader (and it's source code and documentation) can be found
included with the Phytec board or available from the NXP website.

Board specific kernel support
============================================
The board-phy3250.c file provides the board specific functions needed for
setting up the PHY3250 platform with Linux. The functions provide board
specific support for the chip specific drivers as follows:
	Keyboard scanner (key scan map)
	SDMMC (power control, insertion status)
	NAND support (Write protect control, MTD partitioning)
	LCD support (display geomnetry, buffer control, power control)
	Ethernet MAC address
	SPI (via SSP) chip select control
	Support for the PCF8563 RTC and the AT256 serial EEPROm
	Miscellaneous system setup
