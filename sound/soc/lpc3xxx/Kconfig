          Say Y or M here if you want to add support for SoC audio
          on the Phytec 3250 board. This requires an I2C channel connected
          to the I2C interface of the UDA1380 codec.

	  The LPC32XX has 2 I2S channels (0 and 1). Normally, I2S0 is
	  used for communications with an I2S codec. If I2S1 should be
	  used instead, select this option. For LPC32XX systems that
	  used the LCD interface, I2S1 must be used.

	  In this mode, the TX WS and bit clocks are driven from the audio

	  to provide TX clocking.

	  This enables the TX WS clock during RX transfers. Some CODECS use
	  the TX clock for internal clock or for RX clocking.
